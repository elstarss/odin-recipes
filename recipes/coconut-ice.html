    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We are once again using a BBC good food recipe for this one</p>
    <p>Only 3 steps yay</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>250g icing sugar <em>sifted, plus extra for dusting</em></li>
        <li>200g dessicated coconut</li>
        <li>pink edible food colouring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, mix together the condensed milk and icing sugar in a large bowl. It will get very stiff. Work the coconut into the mix until it’s well combined – use your hands, if you like.</li>
        <li>Split the mix into two and knead a very small amount of food colouring into one half. Dust a board with icing sugar, then shape each half into a smooth rectangle and place one on top of the other. Roll with a rolling pin, re-shaping with your hands every couple of rolls, until you have a rectangle of two-tone coconut ice about 3cm thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate or board and leave uncovered for at least 3 hrs or ideally overnight to set. Cut into squares with a sharp knife and pack into bags or boxes. These will keep for up to a month at least, if stored in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
