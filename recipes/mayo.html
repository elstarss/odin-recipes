    <p>Who needs to buy mayo when making it is so easy!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1tsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>250ml sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1tbsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the egg yolks and mustard into a bowl, season with salt and pepper and whisk together until completely combined. Whisking constantly, add a small drop of oil and whisk until completely combined, then add another drop and continue a drop at a time until the yolks and oil combine and start to thicken. Once youâ€™re confident the oil and eggs are coming together you can add the oil a bit more at a time, but be patient, as adding the oil too quickly will cause the mayonnaise to split and curdle.</li>
        <li>Once all the oil has been whisked into the eggs and you have a thick, spoonable mayonnaise, whisk in the vinegar or lemon juice and season to taste. <em>Will keep in the fridge for two days.</em></li>
    </ol>
